Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) have become essential for enabling 
communication in environments where traditional infrastructure is unavailable, 
such as disaster recovery zones and military operations. These networks are 
self-configuring and decentralized, consisting of mobile nodes that wirelessly 
establish temporary connections. However, MANETs present significant 
challenges for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which was originally 
designed for stable, wired networks. In MANET environments, frequent 
topology changes, limited bandwidth, and high node mobility lead to degraded 
TCP performance, including increased latency, higher packet loss, and 
inefficient bandwidth utilization.
To address these issues, this project proposes a novel variant of routing 
protocols specifically tailored for MANETs to improve TCP performance. This 
new variant incorporates adaptive strategies aiming to enhance the reliability 
and efficiency of data transmission. Through extensive simulations using tools 
like NS-3, the proposed variant is rigorously compared against existing 
protocols, such as AODV and DSR, demonstrating its potential to reduce 
latency, minimize packet loss, and improve overall network throughput in 
dynamic MANET environments
